# AI-Driven Environmental Monitoring and Conservation

## Introduction
This project outlines the development and implementation of an AI model designed to analyze satellite imagery and IoT data for monitoring and predicting environmental changes such as deforestation and air quality. The model aims to provide actionable insights for conservation efforts.

## Problem Statement
The task is to create an AI model that analyzes satellite imagery and IoT data to monitor and predict environmental changes, such as deforestation or air quality, and suggests actionable insights for conservation efforts.

## Solution Overview
Our solution involves two main approaches:

### First Approach:
- Build individual models for detecting deforestation from satellite images and predicting air quality from time series air quality data.
- Save both models and combine their outputs using a weighted average or similar method to give the final predicted output.

### Second Approach:
- Build a deforestation detection model using satellite images.
- Use the output of the deforestation model as input features for the air quality prediction model, along with the original air quality features.

Due to limited computation power and time, we were unable to fully implement the ensemble approaches. As of now, we have individual models, but we plan to work on the ensembles in the future.
